# Personal AI Chatbot

Welcome to your very own Personal AI Chatbot! Ever felt the need for a friend? Or perhaps you want to create one that understands you better each day? Look no further! This AI chatbot is here to engage, learn, and become a reflection of your interactions.

## Have No Friends? Teach One and Make It Yours!

This chatbot isn't just about answering questions; it's about growing with you. Every interaction you have with it helps mold its responses, making it a unique companion tailored to your preferences and conversations.

## Features
- **Personalized Interactions**: As you chat more, the bot learns and adapts to your style.
- **Local Storage**: Save and retrieve previous conversations for a more continuous experience.
- **Clear Commands**: Use special commands like `#clear@` to reset and start anew.
- **Modify Bot Responses**: Introducing the `#change@` command! Want to tweak a bot response? Just type `#change@` during the chat. The bot will ask for a new response, and it'll update its database accordingly!

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Ai_Brain_cpu.html` in a web browser.
3. Begin your conversation with the chatbot and watch it adapt and grow with each interaction!
